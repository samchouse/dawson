# SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS:

1. Write a function that calculates the amount of money that a company must pay a freelancer for their work each month. Assume there are \* hours a day and 22 working days in a month, and a discount may be applied.

Inputs: a float of hourly salary and a float discount in form of (25.0).
Output: the amount to be paid by the company

Solution:

```py
def monthly_salary(hourly_wage: float, discount: float) -> float:
  base_monthly_salary = hourly_wage * 8 * 22
  return round(base_monthly_salary * (discount / 100))
```
